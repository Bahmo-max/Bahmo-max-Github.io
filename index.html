            <p>Currently, I am a dedicated student at the University of Cincinnati, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology,
                 with an expected graduation in May 2028. Alongside my studies, I worked at Walmart as a Cart Attendant, a role where 
                 I've honed my skills in efficient operations and customer service. My time as an Online Pickup Clerk at Kroger,
                  where I significantly improved department efficiency, 
                has further developed my ability to maintain an organized and effective work environment.</p>
