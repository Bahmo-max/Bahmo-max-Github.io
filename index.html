        <h3>About Me </h3>
        <p>Ambitious IT Freshman at University of Cincinnati|Eager Learner Exploring Tech Solutions Building a Strong Foundation in Coding and Game development" </p>
        <p>Currently, I am a dedicated student at the University of Cincinnati, 
        pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, with an expected graduation in May 2028.
        Alongside my studies, I worked at Walmart as a Cart Attendant, where I honed my skills in efficient operations and customer service. 
        My time as an Online Pickup Clerk at Kroger, where I significantly improved department efficiency, 
        has further developed my ability to maintain an organized and effective work environment.
        At Kroger, our team's efforts led to a 50% increase in department efficiency through meticulous item picking and packing for online orders.
         This experience, coupled with my role at Walmart, has taught me the importance of teamwork and provided opportunities to contribute to a positive customer experience. 
         I am committed to leveraging my growing knowledge in information technology to bring innovative perspectives and solutions to the teams I work with, always prioritizing collaboration and customer satisfaction.
